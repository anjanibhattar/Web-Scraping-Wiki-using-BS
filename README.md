# Web-Scraping-Wiki-using-BS
In this project, I've attempted to learn and implement the basics of web scraping using the Python library, Beautiful Soup to scrape content from a Wikipedia page containing the list of all aircraft accidents and incidents resulting in at least 50 fatalities.

URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_accidents_and_incidents_resulting_in_at_least_50_fatalities

This Wikipedia page lists out all the fatal aircraft accidents and incidents globally that resulted in an estimated 50 fatalities at the least, in a single occurence. This includes both commerical and military passenger and cargo aircrafts along with general aviation flights.
