# Web-Scraping-Wiki-using-BS
In this project, I've attempted to learn and implement the basics of web scraping using the Python library, Beautiful Soup to scrape content from a Wikipedia page containing the list of all aircraft accidents and incidents resulting in at least 50 fatalities.

**URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_aircraft_accidents_and_incidents_resulting_in_at_least_50_fatalities

The list of 549 records containing 8 variables (columns) are available in a table which I've scraped using the BeautifulSoup library in Python.

Inspecting the HTML of the Wikipedia page, it can be observed that the text in the first 5 columns, related to Deaths are available within the <th> tags within the table, while the text in the rest of the columns is available within the <td> tags.

I've extracted data from the first 5 columns with the <th> tags into one dataframe and the data from the rest of the columns with the <td> tags into another data frame and concatenated them into a single dataframe.

I've referred to several websites and blogs to understand the basics of web scraping and using the BeautifulSoup library along with the BS4 documentation.
